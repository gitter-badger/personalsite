### Google G suite System Administration
<!-- TODO: Reavaluate the need to add a service page This could just be the product Page -->
<!-- IDEA: The services page needs to be inclusive of the network of Providers I have available  -->
I can also leverage my history of developing and intergrating Business Operations tools into any existing organizational workflow. My personal preference tends towards a suite of tools offered by Google. Simple to use, simple to learn, replicatable expierenences for the entire team at a price point that is best in the market.

### SEO and Web Marketing

Direct to customer advertising is not enough. Pay for click ads rarely return the investment Business owners expect or hope for. I take a different approach. It is better to meet your customers right where they are. To provide a service they actually need. Innovation in machine learning with Facebook, google, and others can get your product in front of the right people at the right time. But who are the right people? My approach by way of learning and naming key demoghaphics and key customer personas will better allow you to not only optimize ad spend but to better understand customers needs when coming to market with new or existing products and services.

### Social Media and Comunity Management

Marketing is a fast paced and ever changing system of getting your Brand, Presence, and Value in front your customers. The web is not a one size fits all system. Buzzwords like Market Share and Market Penetration do little to inform the small business owner who their customers are. With a detailed and tailered social plan in place a small buisness owner can not only understand _Their_ customers but reach them in a mannor appropriate. [Case Study](#)

### Web site Hosting and Optimization

With business technology moving at an ever increasing rate of change it is important to know that not only is your business website as fast and accurate as it can be. It is also important to know that your investment of time and resources is going to have lasting value. [Case Study](#)

### Direct Sourcing of Hardware

Special Product sourcing for Small Hardware and software. I spend a lot of time reaserching the hardware and software for my own small business and pass that knowledge along to my clients. Whether that is in the form of optimazing their current website or software system suite. Or the purchase of Desktops and Laptops. I am always looking for the latest trends and cost saving features attempting to future proof my own operations. I can assist in the procurement of just about any technology. [Case Study](#)

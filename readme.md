# Personal Site Project.

## Summery

I am making this project in order to create personal site for myself including blogging and branding purposes. The general idea is to have some place to point to myself and have something to show. It might turn into a place to have my business stuff at. I don't know about that yet. At the least it needs to be a portfolio.

## Research

I have looked around and decided to try and set this up as a netlifly cms site. There is some drawbacks to this but not deal breakers. It is interesting to me the push in mid 2018 for **JAMstack** applications and this seems to be something I can get behind and probably use as a revenue stream.

## Requirements

- Easy to use both from the **REPO** and the web _UI_. Both are needed. Eventually the possibility to do eCommerce digital products as well as physical sales.
- Simple design that allows both some customization but with enough inbuilt that I dont spen all my time working on the theme on no other time on the marketing.
- Super Cheap to no cost. Either use Gitlab pages or Netlifly. I want to use both for the heck of it. I just don't know which to use first.
- JS the whole way. Needs to give some exposure to a complete site. I will need to extend it later on for customers.

## Design

I will start with whatever comes out of the box. Little to know themeing. I don't want to get stuck in the weeds

- Skeleton design until it is running
- Wireframe it first
- Intstall and getting working second
- super fast and clean is the most important on mobile. Desktop is second

## Content and SEO

I am using this as a showcase for my work and will need this to look good. But it is also a way to work on my own intergrations for others. Whether on the open source or on the plugin for profit side.

- Use the content you are already creating. This is going to be the first place you publish content.

## Development

Use this time to work at real world issues. Showcase this as public if possible. You will need to decide on that for sure. Allowing one week for this to be completed.

## Testing.

TDD is going to be important for you later. Do not worry about it now. Just get it running.

## Ongoing improvements

One the site is running and getting hits you acan evaluate what to do next. Do not forget to document everything in the wiki.
